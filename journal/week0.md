# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## Required Tasks

### Install AWS CLI

I was not able to use Github to install AWS CLI 
I started with it but along the line, I got stuck and couldn't figure out where the mistake was coming from.
So I decided to use a local environment to install AWS CLI.

I installed the AWS CLI through the **Command prompt**
```
msiexec.exe /i https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi

```
I confirmed the installation using the command prompt by typing cmd in the Start menu and typed 
```
aws --version
```

### Homework Challenges

I had several homework challenges. One of which was my inability to install CLI on Github.

I started installing it but got stuck along the line and couldn't figure out my mistake or go back to start afresh.

Another challenge I had was my inability to use Cloudshell in my management console for the IAM user, the error message I get is: unable to start the environment. To retry, refresh the browser, or restart by selecting Actions, Restart AWS Cloudshell.
